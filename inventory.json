			"description": "Delorean DMC 12 with a very low mileage of only 3200 miles.  It's the desirable 5 speed manual with a black interior, original Craig radio, tool kit, jack, space saver spare wheel, early black door locks and even original tyres!  it starts right up no smoke or issues, it drives as it should although if you are going to use it on the road new tyres would be advisable.  You can see from the pictures that this is a very clean, low millage, original example of a classic that has been consistently increasing in value."

			"make": "Sunbeam",
			"model": "Saloon",
			"year": "1931",
			"price": "$35,999",
			"color": "ForestGreen",
			"purchased": false,
			"description": "The Sunbeam boasts a strong engine, robust gearbox and generally very good mechanicals. Brakes have been recently overhauled, the car drives incredibly well with good performance coming from the 16hp engine and this is a pre-war that can be regularly used and has proven reliable. GP 7295 comes with a VSCC eligibility document from 2011 and is certainly capable of long distance touring and regular use. The car has everything in terms of originality, provenance, paperwork, reliability, usability and of course the quality and luxury coming from a top class British manufacturer of its day."
